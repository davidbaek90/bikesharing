<b>Checkout Times for Users</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/1.PNG">
    </br>- Most of the NYC Citi Bike users checked out for 20 minutes or less. Peak checkout time is 5 minutes.
</p>

<p align="center">
<b>Checkout Times by Gender</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/2.PNG">
    </br>- Male population had almost triple amount of trip duration compared to female. with about 5% of the survey data did not specify gender

<b>Trips by Weekday per Hour</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/3.PNG">
    </br>- During the week, peak hours were around 8AM and 5:30PM where rush hours traffic is present. On weekdays, more dispersed bike usage throughout 10AM to 5PM is observed.

<b>Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/4.PNG">
    </br>- Male users took advantage of the Citi Bike program much more than female users. Time and day of the week pattern is similar for both and similar to the "Trips by Weekday per Hour shown in previous story".

<b>User Trips by Gender Weekday</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/5.PNG">
    </br>- The heatmap of user trips by gender throughout the week shows that male subscribers are dominant users. Their highest usage showing on Monday to Tuesday, and Thursday to Friday. Female subscribers show a similar patter but to a reduced amount.

<b>Customers vs Subscribers</b></br>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidbaek90/bikesharing/main/image/6.PNG">
    </br>- Number of subscribers is roughly more than three times compared ot the number of non-subscribed customers

    </br>- During the week, peak hours were around 8AM and 5:30PM where rush hours traffic is present. On weekdays, more dispersed bike usage throughout 10AM to 5PM is observed.

## Summary
- The evidence of bike sharing data show a popular demand throughout the city. We have gathered the data and put it to a visualization to show a bikesharing platform usage based on time of the day, day of the week, usage by gender, by subscribers and locations of pickup/dropoff. In general, we see a high demand of bike sharing for short trip duration (less than 30 minutes), this demand is vastly derived from male subscribers. On the weekdays rush hour timing is shown a high demand and weekend through the morning and afternoon. Majority of the bikes picked are returned to the same location.
- In order to better understand the repair service requirement, I high recommend visualizing a correlationship between individual bike utilization and repair frequency. To help reduce downtime of bike availaibility. Second visualization that can help would be to map out a visualization of highly concentrated bike pickup locations, so that we can focus on supplying sufficient number of bikes at thos target locations.
